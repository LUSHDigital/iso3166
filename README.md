# ISO3166

This repository contains data for both ISO3166-1-Alpha-2 and ISO3166-1-Alpha-3 standards.

This repository's generated code is built using the data provided by [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/core/country-code).

This package exposes each country code as a constant, as well as a slice of valid codes, so you can build validation methods around it.
